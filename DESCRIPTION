Description: Implements the BLUP|GA genomic prediction model, AKA "GBLUP given Genetic Architecture". 
  This model uses GBLUP but modifies the G-matrix by weighting SNPs that the user deems are more important (i.e. part of the architecture of the trait being analysed).
  A key problems of GBLUP is that it assumes the infinitessimal model where all SNPs are treated the same and are assumed to explain an 
  equally small proportion of trait genetic variance. This is a biologically incorrect assumption for many traits. BLUP|GA helps resolve this.

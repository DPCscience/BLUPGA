\title{run a GWAS using a training set of samples to estimate marker effects}
\usage{
est_SNPeffects(phenodata, genomat, valset, fixmat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{phenodata}{data frame with 2 columns. One col must be named 'ID' and contain sample IDs. Another column must be named 'y' and contain the phenotypes. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{genomat}{matrix of genotypes in -1,0,1 format (i.e. 0 is heterozygous, 1 and -1 are opposing homozygous states)}

\item{valset}{vector of indices Defaults to NULL.}
}
\value{
a vector of squared SNP effects, one per SNP in \code{genomat}, estimated with the EMMAX GWAS method from the 'cpgen' package.
}
\description{
This function runs the BLUP|GA method where SNPs with the greatest squared effect size are weighted in the GRM prior to GBLUP
}
